# RasPipBoy

*Forked from the original project by [Neal D Corbett](https://bitbucket.org/selectnone/raspipboy/)*

This is the [Pip-Boy 3000 user interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iHNDYLm9-A&list=PLickeZlNSDh1gQIhxbzHKZVxq465AhWfz&index=1) from the game [*Fallout 3*](http://fallout.bethsoft.com/), written in Python for the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) single-board computer.

## Features
* Reasonably accurate simulation of the *Fallout 3* Pip-Boy interface!
    * (at least the bits I've completed so far...)
* GPS-enabled map
* V.A.T.S. camera option
* Wifi-strength meter
* NOT RADIOACTIVE
